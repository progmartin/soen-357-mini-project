notes:
1.statistics may be exagerated, unsure
2.some kids are very hooked on screens, since they are still learning self control, created disturbance in family homes
3.20/20/20 rule
blue light at 449nm causes harmfull ROS, 470nm does not do much harm.  laptop/devices not represent biohazard
4. staying inside and not having enough sunlight may cause Nearsightedness 
5. activities spent on screen matters, stuying =/= playing games =/= instatgram screen time effect =/= procastination
6.kids get crafty to remove parental control on devices lol
7.its mostly kids, who have less self controll, who spend more time on screen, because apps/programs are designed to keep audience engaged
